# notice how we are using print instead of puts here. change it to puts
# and see what happens
# Prints variables end1 through end6.
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6
# Prints variables end7 through end12.
# Print doesn't force a line break or even a space in the shell. Real cool.
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12

# this just is polite use of the terminal, try removing it
# Adds a line break between the last line of code and the shell prompt.
