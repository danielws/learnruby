# This prints the sentence in parenthesis.
puts "I will now count my chickens:"

# Prints the word "Hens" and then computes and prints the answer to the equation.
puts "Hens", 25.0 + 30.0 / 6.0

# Prints the word "Roosters", Executes the equation according to the order of - 
# operations. PEMDAS (parenthesis | Equals | Multiply | Divide | Addition | Subtract)
puts "Roosters", 100.0 - 25.0 * 3.0 % 4.0

# Prints the words in parentheses.
puts "Now I will count the eggs:"

# Prints the answer to the equation (PEMDAS)
puts 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 - 5.0 + 4.0 % 2.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 + 6.0

# Wow I skip spaces after operators a lot. Watch out for that.

# Prints the characters and operators in the qoutes. Ruby prints them literally.
# It doesn't prints the equation and doesn't execute it.
puts "Is it true that 3.0 + 2.0 < 5.0 - 7.0?"

# Prints the answer to this equation.
puts 3.0 + 2.0 < 5.0 -  7.0

# Prints the sentence and equation, then calculates and prints the answer to the equation.
puts "What is 3.0 + 2.0?", 3.0 + 2.0

# Prints the sentence and equation, then calculates and prints the answer to the equation.
puts "What is 5.0 - 7.0?", 5.0 - 7.0

# Prints the sentence and equation, then calculates and prints the answer to the equation. 
puts "What is 3.0 + 2.0?", 3.0 + 2.0

# Prints the sentence and equation, then calculates and prints the answer to the equation. 
puts "What is 5.0 - 7.0?", 5.0 - 7.0

# Prints the sentence in qoutes.
puts "Oh, that's why it's false."

puts "How about some more."

puts "Is it greater?", 5.0 > -2.0
puts "Is it greater or equal?", 5.0 >= -2.0
puts "Is it less or equal?", 5.0 <= -2.0
